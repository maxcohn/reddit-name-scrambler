# reddit-name-scrambler

Firefox extension that generates a random string and replaces all instances of
the user's name on reddit pages with it.

## Why?

This adds a _thin_ layer of privacy to your reddit browsing experience. I don't
like people watching me browse /r/rust for three hours at a time.

Also, I hadn't written any JS in a while, so I figured this would be a nice
refresher, and wow have they made the language better and really improved the DOM
APIs.
